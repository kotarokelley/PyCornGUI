# Project Name

PyCornGUI

## Synopsis
A GUI editor to extract and edit data from .res files generated by UNICORN Chromatography software supplied with AKTA Systems.


## Motivation

Although the available UNICORN software works for editing chromatorgraphy traces, I found that there were many features that were cumbersome to use. For example, aligning and overlaying multiple traces took many steps. Outputting and printing traces for use in lab meetings similarly took multiple steps and were not publication quality. PyCornGUI is a basic, no frills editor that retain and enhance the essential features of the UNICORN software. Automated processing of large number of trace files eliminates the need for tedious individual editing. The res file parsing script is borrowed from [pycorn](https://github.com/pyahmed/PyCORN).
